# ü™± Statistical Analysis of Nematode Populations in Chrysanthemum Crops

üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes the effect of different treatments (bacterial, chemical, control, and fungal) on nematode populations.
The goal is to apply a complete statistical analysis workflow: from data preparation to interpretation of results.


## Research Question & Hypotheses

- Research Question: Do different flower treatments (bacterial, chemical, control, and fungal) significantly affect nematode populations?

- Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): There are no significant differences in nematode populations between the treatments.

- Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): At least one treatment significantly affects nematode populations.


## Methodology

The study analyzed the counts of four types of nematodes: Paratylenchus, Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, and Free-living nematodes. Given the non-parametric nature of the data, the analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis H test to determine if there were significant differences in nematode counts across the four treatment groups. Post-hoc analysis was then performed to identify which specific groups had significant differences.


## üìä Key Findings

‚úÖ The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a statistically significant difference in the populations of Paratylenchus, Meloidogyne, and Pratylenchus nematodes across the treatments.

‚úÖ The post-hoc analysis confirmed that the bacterial and chemical treatments were significantly more effective than the control group in reducing the population of Meloidogyne, the most pathogenic nematode type.

‚úÖ No significant differences were found in the Free-living nematode populations.

## Conclusions & Implications

This analysis supports the conclusion that both the bacterial and chemical treatments are highly effective at reducing the population of harmful nematodes, particularly Meloidogyne. These findings have important implications for crop management and could lead to more sustainable and effective pest control strategies.


## Study Limitations & Next Steps

### Limitations: 
The current study is limited by its sample size and the specific environment (Chrysanthemum crop), which may not be generalizable to other crops or conditions.

### Next Steps:

* Validate the results through larger-scale experiments or in different growing seasons.

* Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing these treatments in a real-world agricultural setting.

* Investigate the underlying biological mechanisms to optimize the treatments further.
